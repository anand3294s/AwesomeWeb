      After a Hmong teenager tries to steal his prized 1972 Gran Torino, a
      disgruntled, prejudiced Korean War veteran seeks to redeem both the boy
      and himself.

      <br />
      <br />
      Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) is a widower who holds onto his prejudices
      despite the changes in his Michigan neighborhood and the world around him.
      Kowalski is a grumpy, tough-minded, unhappy old man who can't get along
      with either his kids or his neighbors. He is a Korean War veteran whose
      prize possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he keeps in mint condition. When
      his neighbor Thao Lor (Bee Vang), a young Hmong teenager under pressure
      from his gang member cousin, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets
      out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Thao's
      family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the gangs that
      infest their neighborhood.
